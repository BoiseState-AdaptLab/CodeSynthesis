# CodeSynthesis
Authors: Tobi Popoola, Flo Ciaglia, Catherine Olschanowsky
## Overview
This is a research piece for generating inspector/executor code for sparse format
conversion. 

## Build Instructions
```shell script
git clone https://github.com/BoiseState-AdaptLab/CodeSynthesis
cd CodeSynthesis
mkdir build/
cd build/
cmake ../
make
```
## Running Synthesis

We currently have preloaded format descriptions for COO, CSR, DIA, BCSR, MORTONCOO 
more formats will be added

```shell script
cd build
./bin/CodeSynthesis_Driver -src <formatname>,<dataName> -dest <formatName>,<dataName>
```

Driver generates synth.h and synth.c files which can be compiled / added to a pre-existing project.

## Build Scripts
Some preset scripts have been generated by the synthesis algorithm, samples of these conversion 
scripts are available for inspection and check.

``` shell script
   make scripts
```

## Unit Tests
```shell script
cd build/
make test
```
